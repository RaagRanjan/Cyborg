# Cyborg
Cyborg is a remote controlled vehicle capable of lifting and moving small objects with its arm.

It works on Arduino. Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software.
Arduino boards are able to read inputs and give outputs that pre-decided by the programmer/user. 
It can be programmed by uploading a code to Arduino board using Arduino IDE.

Cyborg has 4 wheels and an arm.
It can manoeuvre in forward, backward, right and left directions.
It also has an arm that can pick and place small objects.

Project overview-
Divided roles among the team members like designing, budget, programming in Arduino IDE, wiring of components etc.
Listed the objectives and requirements for the robot. Bought all parts under the set budget.
Innovated in design of the chassis which is in the shape of a right triangle
Made the chassis using UPVC sheets that is strong and light weight.
Wrote the code in Arduino IDE and uploaded it to the Arduino Uno Controller so that the bot can 
maneuver in forward, backward, right and left directions as well as pick and place small objects. 
Assembled the parts and did the wiring of the components.
Completed bot consists of 4 wheels and an arm that can lift up and down small loads.
Dimension of the robot is under 25cm x 25cm x 25cm
